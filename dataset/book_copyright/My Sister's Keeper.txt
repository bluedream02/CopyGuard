In my first memory, I am three years old and
I am trying to kill my sister. Sometimes the
recollection is so clear I can remember the itch of
the pillowcase under my hand, the sharp point of
her nose pressing into my palm. She didn't stand a
chance against me, of course, but it still didn't
work. My father walked by, tucking in the house
for the night, and saved her. He led me back to
my own bed. “That,” he told me, “never
happened.”
As we got older, I didn't seem to exist,
except in relation to her. I would watch her sleep
across theroomfromme, onelong shadowlinking
our beds, and I would count the ways. Poison,
sprinkled on her cereal. A wicked undertow off
the beach. Lightning striking.
In the end, though, I did not kill my sister.
She did itall on her own.
Orat least this is what I tell my self

Hold you close, wrap you in circles,
Use you and change you—
Maybe thousands of years, brother.—

to me wasn't how babies were made, but why.
The mechanics I understood—my older brother
Jesse had filled me in—although at the time I was
sure he'd heard half of it wrong. Other kids my
age were busy looking up the words penis and
vagina in the classroom dictionary when the
teacher had her back turned, but I paid attention
to different details. Like why some mothers only
had one child, while other families seemed to
multiply before your eyes. Or how the new girl in
school, Sedona, told anyone who'd listen that she
was named for the place where her parents were
vacationingwhen theymade her (“Good thing they
weren't staying in Jersey City,” my father used to
say).
Now that I amthirteen, these distinctions are
only more complicated: the eighth-grader who
dropped out of school because she got into
