Chapter One
Bruno Makes a Discovery
(page 1) One afternoon, when Bruno came home from school, he
was surprised to find Maria, the family's maid - who always kept
her head bowed and never looked up from the carpet - standing in
his bedroom, pulling all his belongings out of the wardrobe and
packing them in four large wooden crates, even the things he'd
hidden at the back that belonged to him and were nobody else's
business.
'What are you doing?' he asked in as polite a tone as he could
muster, for although he wasn't happy to come home and find
someone going through his possessions, his mother had always
told him that he was to treat Maria respectfully and not just
imitate the way Father spoke to her. 'You take your hands off my
things.'
Maria shook her head and pointed towards the staircase behind
him, where Bruno's mother had just appeared. She was a tall
woman with long red hair that she bundled into a sort of net
behind her head, and she was twisting her hands (page 2)
together nervously as if there was something she didn't want to
have to say or something she didn't want to have to believe.
'Mother,' said Bruno, marching towards her, 'what's going on? Why
is Maria going through my things?'
'She's packing them,' explained Mother.
'Packing them?' he asked, running quickly through the events of
the previous few days to consider whether he'd been particularly
naughty or had used those words out loud that he wasn't allowed
to use and was being sent away because of it. He couldn't think of
anything though. In fact over the last few days he had behaved in
a perfectly decent manner to everyone and couldn't remember
causing any chaos at all. 'Why?' he asked then. 'What have I
done?'
Mother had walked into her own bedroom by then but Lars, the
butler, was in there, packing her things too. She sighed and threw
her hands in the air in frustration before marching back to the
staircase, followed by Bruno, who wasn't going to let the matter
drop without an explanation.
