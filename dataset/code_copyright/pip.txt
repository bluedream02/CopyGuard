Getting Started
To get started with using pip, you should install Python on your system.

Ensure you have a working pip
As a first step, you should check that you have a working Python with pip installed. This can be done by running the following commands and making sure that the output looks similar.


Linux
python --version
Python 3.N.N
python -m pip --version
pip X.Y.Z from ... (python 3.N.N)

MacOS

Windows
If that worked, congratulations! You have a working pip in your environment.

If you got output that does not look like the sample above, please read the Installation page. It provides guidance on how to install pip within a Python environment that doesn’t have it.
