In Python, the distinction between what is the public API of a library and what are private implementation details is not always clear. Unlike in other languages like Java, it is possible in Python to access “private” functions or objects. Occasionally this may be convenient, but be aware that if you do so your code may break without warning in future releases. Some widely understood rules for what is and isn’t public in Python are:

Methods / functions / classes and module attributes whose names begin with a leading underscore are private.

If a class name begins with a leading underscore, none of its members are public, whether or not they begin with a leading underscore.

If a module name in a package begins with a leading underscore none of its members are public, whether or not they begin with a leading underscore.

If a module or package defines __all__, that authoritatively defines the public interface.

If a module or package doesn’t define __all__, then all names that don’t start with a leading underscore are public.
