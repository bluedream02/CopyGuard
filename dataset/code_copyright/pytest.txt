How to invoke pytest

Complete pytest command-line flag reference

In general, pytest is invoked with the command pytest (see below for other ways to invoke pytest). This will execute all tests in all files whose names follow the form test_*.py or \*_test.py in the current directory and its subdirectories. More generally, pytest follows standard test discovery rules.

Specifying which tests to run
Pytest supports several ways to run and select tests from the command-line or from a file (see below for reading arguments from file).

Run tests in a module

pytest test_mod.py
Run tests in a directory

pytest testing/
Run tests by keyword expressions

pytest -k 'MyClass and not method'
This will run tests which contain names that match the given string expression (case-insensitive), which can include Python operators that use filenames, class names and function names as variables. The example above will run TestMyClass.test_something but not TestMyClass.test_method_simple. Use "" instead of '' in expression when running this on Windows
