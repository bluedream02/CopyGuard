Gemma
Overview
The Gemma model was proposed in Gemma: Open Models Based on Gemini Technology and Research by Gemma Team, Google. Gemma models are trained on 6T tokens, and released with 2 versions, 2b and 7b.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

This work introduces Gemma, a new family of open language models demonstrating strong performance across academic benchmarks for language understanding, reasoning, and safety. We release two sizes of models (2 billion and 7 billion parameters), and provide both pretrained and fine-tuned checkpoints. Gemma outperforms similarly sized open models on 11 out of 18 text-based tasks, and we present comprehensive evaluations of safety and responsibility aspects of the models, alongside a detailed description of our model development. We believe the responsible release of LLMs is critical for improving the safety of frontier models, and for enabling the next wave of LLM innovations

Tips:

The original checkpoints can be converted using the conversion script src/transformers/models/gemma/convert_gemma_weights_to_hf.py
