Getting Started with Detectron2
This document provides a brief intro of the usage of builtin command-line tools in detectron2.

For a tutorial that involves actual coding with the API, see our Colab Notebook which covers how to run inference with an existing model, and how to train a builtin model on a custom dataset.

Inference Demo with Pre-trained Models
Pick a model and its config file from model zoo, for example, mask_rcnn_R_50_FPN_3x.yaml.

We provide demo.py that is able to demo builtin configs. Run it with:
