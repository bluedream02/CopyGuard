Requests is an elegant and simple HTTP library for Python, built for human beings.

Behold, the power of Requests:

r = requests.get('https://api.github.com/user', auth=('user', 'pass'))
r.status_code
200
r.headers['content-type']
'application/json; charset=utf8'
r.encoding
'utf-8'
r.text
'{"type":"User"...'
r.json()
{'private_gists': 419, 'total_private_repos': 77, ...}
See similar code, sans Requests.

Requests allows you to send HTTP/1.1 requests extremely easily. There’s no need to manually add query strings to your URLs, or to form-encode your POST data. Keep-alive and HTTP connection pooling are 100% automatic, thanks to urllib3.
