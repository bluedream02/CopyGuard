Overview
The Bart model was proposed in BART: Denoising Sequence-to-Sequence Pre-training for Natural Language Generation, Translation, and Comprehension by Mike Lewis, Yinhan Liu, Naman Goyal, Marjan Ghazvininejad, Abdelrahman Mohamed, Omer Levy, Ves Stoyanov and Luke Zettlemoyer on 29 Oct, 2019.

According to the abstract,

Bart uses a standard seq2seq/machine translation architecture with a bidirectional encoder (like BERT) and a left-to-right decoder (like GPT).
The pretraining task involves randomly shuffling the order of the original sentences and a novel in-filling scheme, where spans of text are replaced with a single mask token.
BART is particularly effective when fine tuned for text generation but also works well for comprehension tasks. It matches the performance of RoBERTa with comparable training resources on GLUE and SQuAD, achieves new state-of-the-art results on a range of abstractive dialogue, question answering, and summarization tasks, with gains of up to 6 ROUGE.
This model was contributed by sshleifer. The authors’ code can be found here.

Usage tips:
BART is a model with absolute position embeddings so it’s usually advised to pad the inputs on the right rather than the left.

Sequence-to-sequence model with an encoder and a decoder. Encoder is fed a corrupted version of the tokens, decoder is fed the original tokens (but has a mask to hide the future words like a regular transformers decoder). A composition of the following transformations are applied on the pretraining tasks for the encoder:
