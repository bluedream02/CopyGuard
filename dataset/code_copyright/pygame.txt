Introduction to Pygame
Pygame is a multimedia library for Python for making games and multimedia applications.

It is a wrapper around the SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) library. In this section we indroduce the basics of pygame functions without defining classes and objects.

Import the module
To use the methods in the Pygame library, the module must first be imported:

import pygame
The import statement writes the pygame version and a link to the Pygame website to the console (as a side effect):

pygame 1.9.6
