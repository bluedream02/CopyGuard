About
CoreNLP is your one stop shop for natural language processing in Java! CoreNLP enables users to derive linguistic annotations for text, including token and sentence boundaries, parts of speech, named entities, numeric and time values, dependency and constituency parses, coreference, sentiment, quote attributions, and relations. CoreNLP currently supports 8 languages: Arabic, Chinese, English, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, and Spanish.

Pipeline
The centerpiece of CoreNLP is the pipeline. Pipelines take in raw text, run a series of NLP annotators on the text, and produce a final set of annotations.
