Subsea cables are critical to the operation of the internet
The diver had found the fibre optic cable lying on the seabed of the North Sea. He swam closer, until it was near enough to touch.
He reached out his hand. But someone could tell he was lurking there. Someone was watching.
"He stops and just touches the cable lightly, you clearly see the signal," says Daniel Gerwig, global sales manager at AP Sensing, a German technology company. "The acoustic energy which travels through the fibre is basically disturbing our signal. We can measure this disturbance."
Multiple reports
of damaged telecommunications cables in the Baltic Sea have raised alarm in recent months.
So important are these cables, which carry huge volumes of internet data between countries, that Nato has launched a mission
called "Baltic Sentry"
, to patrol the Baltic Sea with aircraft, warships and drones.
The EU is also
stepping up measures
to monitor and protect cables.
Despite those efforts the authorities cannot be everywhere at once.
So, some companies are trying to monitor what's going on in the vicinity of any cable – by using fibre optic signals to listen out for surreptitious underwater drones, or hostile vessels dragging their anchors along the seabed.

It was during tests of AP Sensing's system last year – not a real attempt at sabotage – that the diver patted his hand on the subsea cable watched over by the firm.
The company also deployed ships, drones and divers with sea scooters to find out how accurately its software could pick out and identify the presence of these vehicles.
And, the team tested whether their cable could "hear" a vessel plunging its anchor into the water.
