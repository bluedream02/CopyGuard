The global
reusable water bottle market was worth around $10bn (£7.7bn) in 2024
. One
study on Italian healthcare workers
suggested that half of them used reusable bottles, while
research involving university students
suggests somewhere between 50% and 81% of participants used these drinking vessels.
But while they help people to stay hydrated, drinking from water bottles regularly, and taking them with us everywhere we go, may also pose health risks. So, should we ditch them, or can those risks be managed?
What exactly is inside reusable water bottles?
While it's usually safe to drink, water from our kitchen taps is not devoid of microbial life. This is why leaving water in your bottle for a few days will encourage bacteria to grow, says Primrose Freestone, associate professor in clinical microbiology at the University of Leicester, in the UK.
Bacteria that can cause human infections thrive at around 37C (98F) Freestone says, but can also multiply at room temperature, around 20C (68F).
"The longer water in a bottle is stored at room temperature, the more bacteria will grow," she says.

One study conducted in Singapore using boiled tap water – which should have killed most bacteria in it – found that bacteria populations can grow rapidly inside water bottles as they are used throughout the day. On average they found that water inside bottles used by adults went from having around 75,000 bacteria per millilitre in mid-morning to more
1-2 million per millilitre
over the course of 24 hours.
