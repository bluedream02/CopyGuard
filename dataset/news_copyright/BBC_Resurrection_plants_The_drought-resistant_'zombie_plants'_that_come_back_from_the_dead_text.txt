photosynthesise.
While such a Lazarus-like ability is common among mosses, ferns and other non-flowering plants, these "resurrection plants" belonged to the angiosperms, or flowering plants, the group that includes every blossoming tree and fruit-bearing, seed-carrying crop. But out of the
352,000 known species of flowering plants
only
240 are resurrection plants
. Scattered across this branch of the tree of life, they are often unrelated, each having independently evolved the ability to live without water. Primarily found growing on the rocky slopes or gravelly soils of
South Africa, Australia and South America
, the tactics used for this zombie-like trick are surprisingly similar – almost as if an ancestral toolkit can be retrieved from deep inside their DNA to deal with the problem of drought.
Farrant, now a professor of desiccation tolerance at the University of Cape Town, has been
studying these unusual plants for over three decades
. Along with several other researchers, she believes the drought-resistant powers found in their genes may be key to adapting agriculture to a future of climate change.
