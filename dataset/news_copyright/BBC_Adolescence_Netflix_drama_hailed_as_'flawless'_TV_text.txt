Stephen Graham co-created Adolescence and stars as dad Eddie
Adolescence shows the aftermath of the stabbing of a teenage girl, with a 13-year-old boy from her school arrested for her murder.
Jamie, the young suspect, is played by newcomer Owen Cooper, with Stephen Graham as his dad.
Its story shines a light on the corrosive impact of social media and misogynist influencers on some teenage boys.
Graham said he was inspired to make the show after seeing two separate reports of boys stabbing girls to death.
"I just thought, what's going on in society where this kind of thing is becoming a regular occurrence?" he told BBC's The One Show.
"I just couldn't fathom it. So I wanted to really have a look and try and shine a light on this particular thing."

Male rage
Writer Jack Thorne said they wanted to "look in the eye of male rage".
The central character had been "indoctrinated by voices" like Andrew Tate's and "voices a lot more dangerous than Andrew Tate's",
Thorne told Radio 4's Front Row
.
Erin Doherty, who plays a child psychologist,
told BBC Radio 4's Today programme
: "This show has the bravery to just peel back the layers and go, let's talk about this thing, because we're still dealing with it today. There are still issues cropping up in the news today.
"So all we can hold ourselves accountable for is having the discussion, and hopefully that's what it does. It just allows parents, aunties, uncles, even just friends, to engage in the conversation."
