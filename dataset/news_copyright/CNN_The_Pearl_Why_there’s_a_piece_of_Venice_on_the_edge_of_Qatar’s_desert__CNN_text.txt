Comfortable and convenient:
“The Pearl is a modern, clean and comfortable place to live,” says Mirna Saayfan, from Lebanon, who has just moved to Floresta Gardens, a green area of single-family homes, and loves the area’s convenience.

It may take its architectural inspiration from Venice, but The Pearl residential development is located several thousand miles away, in Qatar.

Venice vibes:
Some of the architecture pays direct homage to Venice — like this bridge over a canal.

Hot spot:
The Pearl is a popular place to live in Qatar, particularly among expats. It's also become something of a tourist attraction.

We’ve all seen the design models showing miniature people happily chatting on tree-lined streets and sitting outside restaurants. But many modern residential developments end up as eerie, empty places, devoid of life and atmosphere.
Sometimes, with the right mix, it can work — and the developments even become tourist attractions.

The Pearl in Qatar is one place that seems to have cracked the formula. Built 20 years ago, this artificial island off the northern end of the capital Doha is a slightly surreal world, with colorful buildings and waterways seeming airdropped in from Venice, alongside marinas crammed with expensive boats.

While works are still ongoing in parts of the island and, yes, some units still stand empty, it has turned into a thriving hub of cosmopolitan residents, cafes, restaurants, shops and leisure facilities.
For visitors to Qatar, it’s worth exploring for its sheer architectural exuberance, and for a gawp at the spotless and rarefied world in which many people here live.
Creating an island
Some three years after construction of the
Palm Jumeirah islands off the Dubai
coast began, Qatar decided to build its own artificial island. The small country was no stranger to land reclamation, having already remodeled its semi-circular Corniche waterfront, and the business hub West Bay, and built Hamad International Airport, which sits on
land that’s 60% reclaimed
from the Arabian Gulf.

Choosing a shallow spot off the eastern coast, on a former pearling site that was much used in pre-oil times, made the reclamation more cost-effective and easier to manage than other island projects, such as those in Dubai, which tended to be placed in deeper waters.
Constructed to resemble a string of pearls, with two larger near-circular bays hemmed with apartment towers, and a few smaller spaced beads at the ends, typically populated with larger single-family villas, including the private Isola Dana reserved for Qatar’s royal family, The Pearl’s unique outline can easily be
seen from space
