—
Maggie Kulyk, a progressive donor and activist in the Atlanta area, has a long list of worries about President Donald Trump: His moves to bypass Congress and swiftly slash the size of government, the financial fallout of his steep tariffs and his decision to install Elon Musk, the world’s richest person, in a powerful government role.
“This chaos is intentional, and it’s terrifying,” she said. But she’s also alarmed by the response from Democrats at the national level. “It has been astoundingly bad. It is as if we are dealing with an analog group in a digital world.”
Since losing the presidency and the Senate last November, Democrats in Washington have struggled to land on a unified message to effectively confront Trump, much to the dismay of some Democratic contributors and activists. The discontent has exploded in recent days over Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer’s vote – along with that of nine other Democrats – to advance a GOP-led funding bill to avert a government shutdown.

A
new CNN poll
underscores Democrats’ challenges: The party’s favorability rating tumbled to 29% this month, a record low – driven in part by its supporters’ views that the party should focus more on trying to thwart the GOP’s agenda.
Some in fundraising circles say the growing frustration is pushing some contributors to prioritize House or state-level races, rather than throw money into flipping the Senate, where Republicans currently hold 53 seats to 47 held by Democratic-aligned senators.
‘Tough and challenging times’
The Democrats’ political woes were complicated by New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen’s announcement last week that she would not seek a fourth term – further endangering the party’s hopes of regaining the majority in the Senate in next year’s midterm elections.
