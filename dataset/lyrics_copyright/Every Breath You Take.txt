Every breath you take
And every move you make
Every bond you break, every step you take
I'll be watchin' you
Every single day
And every word you say
Every game you play, every night you stay
I'll be watchin' you
Oh, can't you see
You belong to me?
How my poor heart aches
With every step you take
Every move you make
And every vow you break
Every smile you fake, every claim you stake
I'll be watchin' you
Since you've gone I've been lost without a trace
I dream at night, I can only see your face
I look around but it's you I can't replace
I feel so cold and I long for your embrace
I keep cryin', "Baby, baby, please"
Oh, can't you see
You belong to me?
How my poor heart aches
With every step you take
Every move you make
And every vow you break
Every smile you fake, every claim you stake
I'll be watchin' you
Every move you make, every step you take
I'll be watchin' you
I'll be watchin' you
Every breath you take, every move you make
Every bond you break (I'll be watchin' you)
Every single day, every word you say
Every game you play (I'll be watchin' you)
Every move you make, every vow you break
Every smile you fake (I'll be watchin' you)
Every single day, every word you say
Every game you play (I'll be watchin' you)
Every breath you take, every move you make
Every bond you break (I'll be watchin' you)
Every single day, every word you say
Every game you play (I'll be watchin' you)
Every move you make, every vow you break
Every smile you fake (I'll be watchin' you)
Every single day, every word you say
Every game you play (I'll be watchin' you)
